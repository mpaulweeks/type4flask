todo:
- fix timestamp issue that appears in non-Chrome browsers
- add tests against current.json for dupe names, cards w/o status, illegal bools
- add add_cards/status_update page
- add datepicker to index (update filter urls to keep current date)
- fix autocard to include recent cards (just use gatherer images)
